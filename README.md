# art-viewer-second-try

This is a project in which I am trying to make a really simple and clean application that gives artists a way to show potential clients how their art will look inside their home. Right now, this is a full-stack project that uses a SQLite database. I am uses React and Redux to create the functionality of the site. 

In the future I am hoping to incorporate elements of Augmented Reality (AR) to make the user experience much more fluid and accurate.
